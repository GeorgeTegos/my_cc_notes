# Tech Interview Student Tips

This interview should last around 1 hour and covers 5 key tech interview formats: review of take home test (previously issued), talk me through a project of yours, paired debugging session, whiteboarding systems design/architecture, and a computer science question.

An interview is an opportunity to do more than solve a problem. It’s a chance to demonstrate the behavioral traits that make you great to work with. We don't expect you to be able to answer all these questions well, but these are the kind of questions you might face out there. We'd like you not to be shocked or scared by these questions, and know how to answer when you don't know the answer.

## Set up

The interview will be conducted by two instructors in a room with a whiteboard - you can imagine we are two developers in the team you will be joining. You will need your laptop.

## Take Home Test Review - 10 minutes 

Submit via feedback form by 9am the day before your interview.

Here is how we expect you to approach a coding challenge, both in an out of interview: 
- Understand the problem.
- Create a step-by-step plan for how you’ll solve it.
- Carry out the plan and write the actual code.
- Look back and possibly refactor your solution if it could be better.

## Talk Me Through A Project - 15 minutes

Submit via feedback form by 9am the day before your interview.

You'll need to share a full-stack project of yours, it can be anything but is most likely to be your python or group project. By the time of your real-world technical interviews you will also have your capstone which might be your preferred one. We *will* look at the code and ask questions about it.

We expect the code to be DRY, SOLID - especially single responsibility within functions and files, with well-named variables, free of print debugging, tested to some extent, and have running instructions in the readme. 

Whenever we ask a question:
- A bad answer denies responsibility or doesn't engage.
- A good answer would explain what we can see in simple terms.
- A great answer would set the context of the problem that was trying to be solved, explains the decision-making process that went into evaluating the possible solutions, and confirms the suitability of the chosen solution while explaining the implementation.

## Paired Debugging - 15 minutes

For this exercise we will work together to fix bugs in a React app. 

We will give you some time to look at the code and you can begin pairing at any time. 

We want you to: 
- Think out loud
- Ask clarifying questions
- Consider approaches
- Use debugging methods: run tests, run the app, use breakpoints, use print debugging.

## Systems Design & Architecture Whiteboarding Session - 15 minutes

We would like for you to talk through how you'd implement a simple design for a complex system i.e. db, backend, frontend. You may want to consider what tables or classes/files would be in each of these parts. We'd like for you to be able to describe how we might productionise this system - by hosting it on the cloud - and consider scalability. 

## Computer Science Questions - 5 minutes

You are unlikely to receive a question like this, but if you do this is how we would like you to respond:
- Repeat the question back and ask clarifying questions so you understand the problem.
- Start by talking through the first solution that comes into your head and elaborate on what would or wouldn't work about it. Don't be afraid to go down one track and back out when you realise that wouldn't work.
- There may be more than one possible answer, the aim is not to get to that but to explore the paths that will get you there.
- The interviewer will prompt you when you're stuck and engage with you throughout - you are not alone!

What you should hope to come across as is a good problem solver as opposed to someone who knows all these questions off the top of their head and can recite an answer.
