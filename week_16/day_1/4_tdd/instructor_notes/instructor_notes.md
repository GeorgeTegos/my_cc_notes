## FAQs

**How do I know what test to write next?**

This is a tough question. Sometimes it can seem random, especially when you
watch someone else doing TDD. Really, it comes down to one question: does
the code do what it's supposed to yet? As long as you can explain *why* that test makes sense then it's probably a reasonable test.

**How do I know when I've written enough tests?**

The more you test-drive your code, the easier it will be to know when you've written the right amount of tests. As a simple guide, though, if you can't write another failing test, then you're probably done.

**When do I stop writing tests?**

This is related to the above question. Really the best way to know is
when you can't find another failing test to write. Then again, if you rush ahead and write too much code without testing, you might find it hard to write a failing test. That doesn't necessarily mean that your code is well-tested.

For now, try not to worry too much about this. You'll get a feeling for it as you go on.

**Do I always need to write tests?**

You know what? Probably not.

Many developers never write code without writing tests first. But there are also lots of developers who write tests after they write their code. For many developers it feels much more fulfilling to have the constant validation of making tests pass throughout the day.

If you don't like writing tests first, that's okay. Maybe you'll learn to like it or maybe you won't. But keep in mind a lot of employers will ask about testing, and it'll be helpful to have a reasonable knowledge of how to write good tests.
