Primitive  (String , Array)
  Does not have any methods

Non-primitive (int , boolean)
int age = 24;
long numberOfPeopleAlive = 8_123_321_123L;
double balance = 103.43;
float newBalance = 103.43F;
char firstInitial = 'G';
boolean isRaining = true;




Casting
Widening Casting
byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double


Narrowing Casting
double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
int myBalance = (int) balance;
if want to use methods        Integer ageInput = scanner.nextInt();
